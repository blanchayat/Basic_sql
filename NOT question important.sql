-- Question:
-- Find employees whose salary is NOT BETWEEN 4000 and 7000
-- and whose job_id is DIFFERENT from 16.


-- ‚ùå Wrong Attempt #1 ‚Äî Error: two WHERE keywords
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 4000 AND 7000 
AND WHERE job_id <> 16;
-- Error: You cannot use two WHERE keywords in one query.
-- Fix: combine all conditions under a single WHERE.


-- ‚ùå Wrong Attempt #2 ‚Äî Error (De Morgan‚Äôs Law)

SELECT first_name, last_name, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE NOT (salary BETWEEN 4000 AND 7000
  AND job_id = 16);
-- This means: (salary NOT BETWEEN 4000 AND 7000) OR (job_id <> 16)
-- It uses OR instead of AND, returning a larger, incorrect set.


-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Teacher‚Äôs Example ‚Äî Works, but be careful with logic
SELECT first_name, last_name, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE NOT salary BETWEEN 4000 AND 7000
  AND NOT job_id <> 16;
-- Note: ‚ÄúNOT job_id <> 16‚Äù is logically equal to ‚Äújob_id = 16‚Äù.
-- So this query finds employees whose salary is not in [4000,7000]
-- AND whose job_id IS 16 ‚Äî not what we actually need!

-- ‚úÖ Correct Answer ‚Äî Clean and logically accurate
SELECT first_name, last_name, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 4000 AND 7000
  AND job_id <> 16;

-- üß† Lesson Learned:
--  Avoid using multiple WHERE keywords ‚Äî use one WHERE with AND/OR.
--  Parentheses matter in logical conditions ‚Äî be explicit.
--  ‚ÄúNOT (A AND B)‚Äù ‚â† ‚ÄúNOT A AND NOT B‚Äù.
--  ‚ÄúNOT job_id <> 16‚Äù = ‚Äújob_id = 16‚Äù ‚Äî be careful!
--  Always verify with COUNT(*) and sample rows.
