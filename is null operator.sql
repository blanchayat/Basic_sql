-- What is NULL?
-- NULL represents a missing, unknown, or unspecified value in a database.

-- Wrong examples:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE phone_number = 'NULL';

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE phone_number = NULL;

-- Correct examples:
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE phone_number IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE phone_number IS NOT NULL;

-- üí°Lesson Learned:
-- NULL means ‚Äúno value.‚Äù
-- It is NOT zero (0), NOT blank (‚Äò‚Äô), and NOT the same as ‚ÄòNULL‚Äô text.
-- Always use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to test for NULLs.
