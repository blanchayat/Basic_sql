--   The LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
--     %  - represents zero or more characters
--     _  - represents a single character

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'B%';

SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'Be__';
--   The two underscores (__) represent two single characters after 'Be'.


SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%r';
--   % matches any sequence of characters before 'r'.

SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%u_';
--   The underscore (_) represents the last character, so 'u' is the second from the end.

SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%s%';
--   %s% finds any title containing the letter 's'.

SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%a%v%';
--   %a%v% means there can be any characters before, between, or after 'a' and 'v'.

SELECT title FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%A%V%' OR title LIKE '%a%v%';
-- It is case-sensitive in most SQL implementations (e.g., 'A%' is different from 'a%').

--ILIKE Operator (PostgreSQL)
-- PostgreSQL supports the ILIKE operator, which works exactly like LIKE,
-- but performs **case-insensitive** pattern matching.
--   - 'CAR%' will match 'Car', 'car', 'CARavan', 'caRpet', etc.
--   - It's very useful when case variations are not important (for example, user input or names).

--Case-insensitive pattern
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'CAR%';

-- Equivalent with LIKE (case-sensitive)
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'CAR%';
-- This version would only match 'CAR...' (uppercase), not 'car' or 'Car'.

-- ðŸ’¡Lesson Learned:
--  - Use ILIKE for case-insensitive pattern matching in PostgreSQL.
--  - Both operators support the same wildcards:
--       '%' for any sequence of characters
--       '_' for a single character.
--   - The LIKE operator is essential for text-based searches and pattern recognition.
--   - Case sensitivity may depend on the database settings (PostgreSQL is case-sensitive by default).
